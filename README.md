# ELO_Bot
This is an inhouse matchmaking Discord bot currently in development.


To use it you will need to get your own bot token from the discord developers site https://discord.com/developers/


You will need Mysql workbench is the only other application you will need.


Make a config.json file in the root and add a field for prefix, your bot token, host (mysql server), user(mysql), pass(mysql pass), and size (how many people in the lobby) 


You can run setup.js to create the database and tables you need.

after that each player just has to -register before joining the lobby!
